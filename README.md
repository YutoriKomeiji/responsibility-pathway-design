Framework for designing responsibility and decision flow in the age of AI

# Responsibility Pathway Design (RPD)

Responsibility Pathway Design (RPD) is a framework for designing how
decisions, delegation, execution, outcomes, and responsibility
flow through organizations in the age of AI.

## Why this matters
AI systems now participate in judgment and execution.
Responsibility must be designed, not assumed.

## Status
Draft v0.1 – Concept definition phase

## Scope
RPD focuses on organizational and societal responsibility design
in environments where AI participates in judgment and execution.

## Non-goals
- This is not a technical AI architecture
- This is not a governance checklist
- This is not a legal framework

## Intended users
- Policymakers
- Executives
- Organizational designers
- AI governance researchers
